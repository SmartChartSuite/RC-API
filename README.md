# SmartPacer Results Combing API (RC-API)

## All of the below information is out of date and needs to be changed
## Installing / Getting started

Prerequisites to install:
- Docker Desktop 3.2.2
- Brew (for MacOS)
- Python 3
- pip 3
- git
- bash/zsh terminal (recommend Iterm for MacOS)
- VS Code (recommended IDE)


## Developing

In order to run the code and test changes, you'll need to clone the code from Enterprise GitHub and set up the Docker containers:

```shell
git clone https://github.gatech.edu/HDAP/SmartPacer-CR-API.git
```
Pull the `main` branch (this is the project main working/dev branch).

Double-check that you're in the same folder as docker-compose.
```shell
cd SmartPacer-CR-API/
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```


### Building

Most changes to code (while developing) have automatic and live updates, so they will be immediately reflected in the browser during testing.

You can also run the api directly inside the VSCode by taping the Run/Debug button.
